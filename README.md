# The Black Jack Game

Welcome to the Black Jack Game! This console-based game offers you the chance to try your luck and skills at the classic card game of Blackjack. In this game, you will 
be playing against the computer dealer, and the objective is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over it. Here's how the game works:

## Getting Started

1. When you start the game, you will be prompted to decide whether you want to play or not.
   - If you select "n," the game will bid you farewell and end.
   - If you select "y," the game will begin.

   Here are the objectives to be fulfilled in the game play: ![Screenshot (688)](https://github.com/AryabhattSingh/TheBlackJackGame/assets/63608694/6cb26d09-9adc-4fa5-8b70-face8a8c868e)

## Gameplay

2. Both you and the computer dealer will start with a hand of 2 random card values drawn from an infinite deck.

3. The game will automatically detect if either you or the computer has a blackjack (an Ace + a 10-value card). 
   - If the computer gets a blackjack, you lose (even if you also have a blackjack).
   - If you get a blackjack, you win (unless the computer also has a blackjack).

4. The scores for both you and the computer are calculated based on the values of the cards in your hands. Aces count as 11, but if the total goes over 21, the value of the Ace is reduced to 1.

5. The computer's first card is revealed to you at the beginning of the game.

6. The game ends immediately if:
   - Your score goes over 21.
   - Either you or the computer gets a blackjack.

7. After your initial two cards, you will be asked if you want to draw another card ("y" for yes, "n" for no). Keep drawing cards until you choose not to or until you go over 21.

8. Once you are done drawing cards, the computer will play. The computer will keep drawing cards until its score goes over 16.

9. After both you and the computer have finished drawing cards, the scores will be compared to determine the game's result.

## End of Game

10. The final hands of both the player (you) and the computer dealer, along with their respective scores, will be displayed to you.

11. The scores of both you and the computer will be compared, and the game's result will be displayed, indicating whether you won, lost, or it's a draw.

## Playing Again

12. After the game ends, you will be asked if you'd like to play again.
   - If you select "y," the game will start fresh.
   - If you select "n," the game will bid you farewell and end.

Enjoy playing The Black Jack Game, and may the odds be ever in your favor!
